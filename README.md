# Recipes-Book

Simple web app to create recipes and agreggate them into menus. Aditionally, it will list all the ingredientes in the Shopping list section so you can see everything you will need to prepare your recipes.
The app was created using React + MeteorJS + MongoDB.

## Motivation
I built this application to learn more about how the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) framework works using React.

## Credits
The code is based on the [Meteor Intermediate playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI8IslJHSag&list=PLLnpHn493BHFYZUSK62aVycgcAouqBt7V) from [LevelUpTuts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU5wkjgQYGRB0hIHMwm2Sg) channel.
